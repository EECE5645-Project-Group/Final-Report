A key area for future development involves adapting the current model, which effectively classifies severe diabetic retinopathy, to also diagnose mild cases. This enhancement would transform the system from a binary to a multiclass classifier, enabling a more comprehensive range of diagnoses. Such an adaptation would not only increase the model's utility in clinical settings but also provide a finer granularity in identifying the progression stages of diabetic retinopathy. Developing this capability would require retraining the model with an expansive dataset inclusive of various stages of the condition and potentially refining the model architecture to better distinguish between these nuanced categories.

Furthermore, implementing federated learning (FL) represents a significant step forward. By training the model across multiple decentralized datasets, this approach respects patient privacy and data security, which is crucial in biomedical applications. Moreover, FL can lead to a more robust and generalized model by learning from diverse and geographically dispersed data sources, each possibly containing unique, site-specific characteristics of diabetic retinopathy. Future work could explore the technical and logistical frameworks required to enable FL, focusing on maintaining model performance and data integrity without direct data sharing.

Enhancing model interpretability is also crucial for clinical acceptance and decision-making. Future developments may focus on incorporating AI-driven segmentation techniques to visually highlight the features identified by the model as indicative of diabetic retinopathy. This visual interpretation layer would provide physicians with valuable insights into the modelâ€™s decision-making process, fostering trust and allowing for a more informed clinical judgment. Such an interpretable AI system could bridge the gap between complex model outputs and practical clinical applications, ensuring that the model's decisions are transparent and understandable to healthcare professionals.
