The dataset used within this project is the Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Dataset provided by Kaggle [2]. The dataset contains over 35,000 high resolution retina images from both eyes, captured under various imaging conditions using different camera models. All images are labeled by a medical professional with a retinopathy progression score on a 0 to 4 scale: 0 (No DR), 1 (Mild), 2 (Moderate), 3 (Severe), and 4 (Proliferative DR). The dataset comes structured in training, testing, and sample files, with a separate file delineating the training labels. Given the different imaging types, visual noise, and image artifacts, a significant challenge lies in developing algorithms robust against these variations, which our CNN models to solve.
